## Currently

I'm a fifth-year Genetics PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, due to finish around September 2017. During my time at UW-Madison I have been studying the microbiome of an invasive copepod species across independent saltwater to freshwater invasions. I am currently working on a project examining parallel evolution in the copepod using pooled population genomics data.

## Education

`2011-15`
__University of Wisconsin - Madison__ Genetics PhD (supervisor: Carol Lee)

`2009-11`
__SUNY Brockport__ BSc Biology (_Summa Cum Laude_)

`2001-03`
__Finger Lakes Community College__ AS General Studies

## Teaching

### TA

GEN 466 Genetics
Bio 100 Exploring Biology

### Lecturer

Bio 100 Exploring Biology

### Undergraduate Mentorship

`2012-15`
Joe Connolly and Khamsai Vang _Culture-based Isolation of Microbial Symbionts from Copepod Hosts_

Sonya Loberger _Detecting Signatures of Selection using Pooled Population Genomics_

### HHMI Teaching Fellowship

I received training in pedagogical methods and active-learning strategies, then developed a team-taught introductory Biology course with my cohort which we taught to Freshmen students. Part of the aim of this fellowship was to aid in the retention of minority and underpriveledged students.

### Teaching Evolution online course

I helped to develop modules for an online teacher-training course for middle and high school teachers. The goal of the online modules was to provide teachers with access to good materials and lesson plans about Evolutionary Biology.

## Activities

### JF Crow Institute for the Study of Evolution

I am a member of the Evolution Coordinating Committee for the Crow Institute at UW-Madision. I am involved in the development of a graduate program in Evolution, as well as in many outreach and teaching activities.

### Evolution Seminar Series

I organize and run the UW-Madison Evolution Seminar Series by inviting all associated speakers and writing grants for funding visiting speakers.

### MoMiEE

I co-founded a group meeting of microbial ecologists and computational biologists on campus which meets monthly to talk about methods in microbial ecology and evolution.

### Evolution Journal Club

I founded and help run a weekly evolution journal club for graduate students and post-docs.
