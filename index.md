## Currently

I'm a fifth-year Genetics PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, due to finish around September 2017. During my time at UW-Madison I have been studying the microbiome of an invasive copepod species across independent saltwater to freshwater invasions. I am currently working on a project examining parallel evolution in the copepod using pooled population genomics data.

## Projects

### blog

I write a data science blog at [blm.io](http://blm.io) where I apply R and Python to open datasets and write-up the results. My posts have been featured by sites including FiveThirtyEight, BuzzFeed, AVclub, io9 and more, and also led to being an invited blogger at the Huffington Post. My original wordpress blog ([benjaminlmoore.wordpress.com](http://benjaminlmoore.wordpress.com)) has received around 150,000 total views from 180 countries.

### EdinbR
I co-founded a usergroup for the R programming language in Edinburgh called EdinbR. I help to organise our monthly meetings and built our website: [edinbr.org](http://edinbr.org). Our meetings attract 30-50 statisticians, data scientists and developers for talks and discussion about the R language and its applications. We're sponsored by Revolution Analytics and have an organisational github account at [github.com/EdinbR](https://github.com/EdinbR).

### datarea

I entered Imperial College's [Summer Data Challenge](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/data-science/education/summer-data-challenge/) competition, where entrants analysed a given dataset and then proposed a startup idea based on their results. I developed a modelling technique to select housing areas for investment and was awarded third place: £2,000 and startup support from Imperial Create Lab. My entry can be seen at [blm.io/datarea](http://blm.io/datarea) and the code is shared on my github account.

## Awards

NSF Graduate Research Fellowhip Program (3 years PhD fees + enhanced stipend)

Genetics Department NIH training grant (2 years PhD fees + stipend)

UW-Madison Zoology research grant ($2500 research funding)

Peter and Rosemary Grant summer research fellowship ($2000 research funding)

## Placements

`2010-11`
__Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute__ (_Cambridge, UK_)
Worked for two summers on the Rfam database ([rfam.xfam.org](http://rfam.xfam.org)) in the Bateman group
