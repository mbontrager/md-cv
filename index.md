## Currently

I'm a fifth-year Genetics PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, due to finish around September 2017. During my time at UW-Madison I have been studying the microbiome of an invasive copepod species across independent saltwater to freshwater invasions. I am currently working on a project examining parallel evolution in the copepod using pooled population genomics data.

## Education

`2011-15`
__University of Wisconsin - Madison__ Genetics PhD (supervisor: Carol Lee)

`2009-11`
__SUNY Brockport__ BSc Biology (_Summa Cum Laude_)

`2001-03`
__Finger Lakes Community College__ AS General Studies

## Teaching

### TA

`2013`
GEN 466 Genetics

`2015`
Bio 100 Exploring Biology

### Lecturer

`2015`
Bio 100 Exploring Biology

### Undergraduate Mentorship

`2012-15`
Joe Connolly and Khamsai Vang _Culture-based Isolation of Microbial Symbionts from Copepod Hosts_

Sonya Loberger _Detecting Signatures of Selection using Pooled Population Genomics_

### HHMI Teaching Fellowship

`2015`
I received training in pedagogical methods and active-learning strategies, then developed a team-taught introductory Biology course with my cohort which we taught to Freshmen students. Part of the aim of this fellowship was to aid in the retention of minority and underpriveledged students.

### Teaching Evolution online course

`2014-15`
I developed modules for an online teacher-training course for middle and high school teachers. The goal of the online modules was to provide teachers with access to good materials and lesson plans about Evolutionary Biology.
